* [FOSDEM](https://video.fosdem.org/2019/Janson/mattermost_layered_extensibility.webm) (8/29/2018) - Mattermost’s Approach to Layered Extensibility in Open Source - Mattermost is an open source, enterprise-grade messaging platform with thousands of contributors. At Mattermost, we set out to build a platform that would support a variety of extensions. Ranging from simple webhooks accepting curl commands, to bot and integration frameworks, a rich plug-in architecture across server and client experiences, to full access to system APIs with language-specific drivers. All of this is built on top of an open source engine with an open and accessible data model in SQL. We’ll chat about our approach to extending the platform as well as tools, technologies, and best practices for developers writing integrations with our developer toolkit.

With thousands of open source installs and hundreds of customer implementations, we have a few lessons to share on interesting DevOps workflows, how incidents can be effectively communicated across distributed teams and what messaging in secure and regulated environments should look like. The main takeaway? Open source software and open APIs give organizations the freedom to adjust their communications infrastructure to their specific needs and transition successfully to ChatOps.
* Open Source Summit (8/29/2018) - Lessons learned building software with a fully remote team - We have learned quite a few lessons about communication tools and how to get work done from our experience of working with hundreds of customers who use Mattermost, an open source messaging workspace, and a distributed team of 50 with hundreds of additional contributors all working remotely. I’ll share several examples of good and suboptimal communication working with remote teams and the infrastructure and tools we found help us, our contributors and our users become more effective teams and provide clarity in their work.
* Community Leadership Summit (7/14/2018) - How to optimize real-time communication in OSS and Community - While email threads, comments on pull requests and IRC have been the norm for communication between developer and open source communities, real-time messaging is becoming increasingly popular. Let’s discuss the good, bad and best practices of chat.
