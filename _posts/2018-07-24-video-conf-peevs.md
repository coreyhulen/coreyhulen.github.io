Below is a list of things I've noticed that annoy me during video conferencing.  Working at a remote company, we spend almost all of our meeting time in video calls vs in person meetings, and people can do annoying things.  I won't lie, I'm probably one of the worst offenders for some of these items:

1. **Responding to messages in chat while you are talking with them**.  Nothing is more distracting than when someone tries to "covertly" respond to a message.  First, it wasn't that covert, I can hear your keyboard and notice you're looking somewhere else. Second, I'm in the same channel as you - I can see the messages `You're typing...`.  **Solution**:  If you feel the need to respond immediately and are easily distracted, set yourself to "Do not disturb" mode while in meetings.

2. **Answering calls or checking text messages on your cell phone**.  If your house is burning down, I'm sure they'll call back.  Yes, I can see you responding to texts - your phone isn't quite out of the frame, and you're looking at your lap.  **Solution**: Put your phone on silent and place it out of arm's reach, face down, so you don't feel compelled to act.

3. **Your video is displayed on a 2nd monitor, causing you to look away from the camera, or you don't look at the camera when talking**.  It almost feels like you're talking to someone else in the room behind your computer monitor.  **Solution**:  Either move your camera, or move your video window so they are somewhat inline and remember to look towards the camera.

4. **Your mute etiquette sucks**.  This is especially true in a large group meeting.  You can hear random noises, like a fan running or a loud click-clack keyboard, which can be distracting for others.  **Solution**: Remember to mute!

5. **Fidgeting uncontrollably or spinning in your office chair**.  **Solution**: Buy a fidget spinner and hold it out of frame, just try not to look at it too much (see #3).  If you're in a group meeting and not doing much talking, feel free to stop your video.

6. **Connecting with your computer but also dialing in via cell phone**.  Now there are two of you in the meeting and the voice/video are not synced when you talk.  In large groups, we'll see a random cell phone number and can't be sure who's lurking.  **Solution**:  Pick one.
