Open source software has become an integral part of the tech industry. It is a type of software whose source code is available to the public, allowing anyone to modify and redistribute it. Working on open source projects can be an enriching experience for people with diverse skill sets. Here are 7 reasons why you should work on open source projects.

1. **Giving back instead of standing on the shoulders of Giants.** When you work on open source projects, you contribute to a global community. You can build upon the work of others and create something even better. Instead of just consuming technology, you can give back to the community by contributing your own ideas and code. This is a fantastic way to make a positive impact on the world, even in small ways.

2. **Learn to work with a remote team.** Open source projects usually have contributors from different parts of the world. This provides an opportunity to work with a diverse team, with different backgrounds and perspectives. It also helps you develop your communication skills and learn how to work effectively in a remote team. These skills are becoming increasingly important as more and more companies are shifting towards remote work.

3. **Turn your Github Green.** When you work on open source projects, you can showcase your contributions on Github. This helps you build a portfolio of work that you can show to potential employers. It also demonstrates your commitment to your craft and your willingness to contribute to the community. A green Github profile is always an impressive sight!

4. **Gain and give knowledge.** Working on open source projects is an excellent way to learn new technologies and programming languages. It also gives you the opportunity to share your knowledge with others. This is because open source projects rely on collaboration and knowledge sharing to succeed. You can also get feedback on your work and improve your skills as a developer.

5. **An introvert's time to excel.** If you are an introvert, open source projects provide a perfect environment to excel. You can work on your own schedule and in your own environment, without the need for constant interaction with others. This allows you to focus on your work and deliver high-quality code. You can also communicate with others through tools like Mattermost, which can be less intimidating than face-to-face interactions.

6. **Work as much or as little as you want.** Open source projects offer a lot of flexibility in terms of the amount of time you can invest. You can work on them as much or as little as you want, depending on your availability and interest. This is a great way to gain experience without having to commit to a full-time job.

7. **You can have a crash pad in a bunch of countries** Open source projects are a global community, so you can work on projects from anywhere in the world. This gives you the opportunity to connect with people from different cultures and work on projects that have a global impact. It also means that you can work on projects while traveling, giving you a crash pad in different countries.

**Bonus - You don't need to be a Developer.** Working on open source projects is not just limited to developers. There are many ways to contribute to open source projects, including documentation, testing, design, and more. This means that you don't need to be a developer to contribute to open source projects. Whatever your skill set, there is likely an open source project that can benefit from your expertise.

Working on open source projects offers a range of benefits, from building a portfolio of work to learning new skills and contributing to a global community. If you're interested in contributing to open source projects, start by finding a project that interests you and reaching out to the community. Who knows, you might just find your next big opportunity!
